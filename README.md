# My First HTML & CSS Project

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the "HTML & CSS for Beginners - Full Course" video by [SuperSimpleDev](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=HEj1uSi7vGZ9BbDM) on YouTube. This project marks my starting point in learning frontend development.

## About The Project

I was always curious about how websites were built, and I loved the idea of recreating famous designs. This project was my first dive into making that happen. The exercises in this repository cover the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, from basic tags and text styling to more advanced concepts like Flexbox, Grid, and Positioning.

This tutorial was incredibly easy to follow and made learning HTML and CSS a fun and engaging experience.

## What's Next?

After completing this course, I took on a bigger challenge!
